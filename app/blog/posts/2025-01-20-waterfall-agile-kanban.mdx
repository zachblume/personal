1. Agile

Before working at Stripe, my experience of software development was the
agile variety: sprints, retrospectives, and standups.

It's so ubiquitous I won't bother writing further about it.

2. Waterfall

Stripe operates differently: "projects" are the focus, and project management
is the primary working style: weekly team meetings, project updates, and
deadlines.

You could call this waterfall (which I believe takes its name from Gantt-style
charts). It's heavyweight planning, a good deal of doc writing, and more or
less the rest of big tech apparently follows similar conventions: see [How Big
Tech Runs Tech Projects and the Curious Absence of
Scrum](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/project-management-at-big-tech/) from
Gergely Orosz.

There's a couple of really good reason for it:

When you have independent teams with overlapping decisions, products, and
development platforms, there needs to be horizontal accountability. So you need
a form of review because any decision one engineer makes is going to be
affecting a giant number of engineers and future projects, and there's far too
many people involved (and simtulaneously being hired and leaving) to assume
anyone can be on the same page without it.

At the same time, engineers are shipping very quickly, i.e. daily, in part
because their changes could be highly conflicted if they don't get into trunk.

These facts combine to mean that it's difficult to redirect something after it
begins building momentum to ship, including as pieces of it start accumulating
in the trunk branch, as they were reviewed in isolation. Which means it's
useful to do heavier planning up-front.

One key difference to modern waterfall is that at Stripe automated testing is
strong and the primary method of testing. People don't really ship changes
without accompanying passing automated tests.

3. Kanban

I need to finish writing this :)
