## Scrum

Before working at Stripe, my experience of software development was the
scrum variety: sprints, retrospectives, and standups.

It's so ubiquitous I won't bother writing further about it. People just assume
its the same thing as agile.

## Waterfall

Stripe operates differently: "projects" are the focus, and project management
is the primary working style: weekly team meetings, project updates, and
deadlines.

You could call this waterfall (which I believe takes its name from Gantt-style
charts). It's heavyweight planning, a good deal of doc writing, and more or
less the rest of big tech apparently follows similar conventions: see [How Big
Tech Runs Tech Projects and the Curious Absence of
Scrum](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/project-management-at-big-tech/) from
Gergely Orosz.

There are some compelling reasons for this approach:

-   With independent teams making overlapping decisions across shared products
    and platforms, there’s a need for structured reviews. Any one engineer’s
    choices could ripple through an enormous codebase, affecting hundreds of
    engineers and future projects. And given the scale of hiring and attrition,
    it’s unrealistic to assume everyone is always on the same page.

-   Engineers ship changes daily to avoid conflicts, as delays increase the
    risk of highly conflicted merges. This fast pace makes it hard to change
    course once something gains momentum. Pieces of a project start
    accumulating in the trunk branch, each reviewed in isolation, making
    upfront planning even more essential.

One modern twist on this “waterfall” approach at Stripe is the strong reliance
on automated testing. Changes almost always ship with passing automated tests,
which minimizes the risk of regressions and reduces the need for heavy manual
QA.

## Kanban

Kanban to me was: engineers working tickets without the ceremonies of
scrum. One thing at a time, and less deadlines.

Before now I never had to work with Jira. We were always working with Linear,
which is a beautiful tool.

Kanban also emphasized the practice of taking a big ticket and systematically
breaking it into smaller ones. This approach blends implementation with
fact-finding. Instead of writing a heavyweight design doc upfront, you dive
into the work, encounter dead ends, and learn as you go. It sacrifices some
up-front clarity but avoids the days or weeks of unproductive debates that can
come with heavier multi-party planning.

## Wrapping up

Each of these approaches has its merits.

For me, scrum is performance management more than project management, and
you're probably better off hiring better engineers and creating a
well-motivated environment.

I think the waterfall/project management approach is somewhat inevitable to
optimize for large systems. It's definitely "slower" but you could say that's a
purposeful philosophical choice along the lines of planned=slower=less
mistakes=faster.

Kanban has a lot to offer to everyone, in my view. I think making planning a
ticket-writing activity forces you to actually think about the units of
implementation, and the flow of working on a single thing at any time is hard
to match without pre-determining those units.
