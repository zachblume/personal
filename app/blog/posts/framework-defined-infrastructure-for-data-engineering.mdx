The pattern in web frameworks has been from imperative to declarative, so
jQuery gave way to React. Instead of pushing around DOM nodes you just write
your end-state and let the magic happen.

Beyond the rendering framework, that's also applied to the package manager for
including dependencies and the file-based router system. I think it's enjoyable
to write things the way you want them. You can see this trend towards
declarative tools across many kinds of development.

There's also been a trend towards zero-config. But the predecessor to
zero-config is actually config. Before you can replace Webpack configs with
Nextjs magic, you first need a declarative bundler management.

So the trend past declarative towards zero config is actually one spectrum, and
you see the same thing with infra: ftp becomes bash scripts becomes
Terraform/docker becomes [framework-defined
infrastructure](https://vercel.com/blog/framework-defined-infrastructure).

I see the same as possible in data engineering:

-   logic and testing: spreadsheets/eyeballs -> SQL-run-in-consoles ->
    SQL-run-in-py-templates -> dbt
-   orchestration: cron scripts -> Airflow
-   infrastructure: we're still in the terraform era here!
-   dashboards: okay, this is also still a place where we're in a horrible
    purgatory of no-code or weird YAML solutions (looking at you LookML)

I think you can see a next step here of framework-defined infrastructure for
data engineering.

We already have the declarative tools for logic and orchestration, but we're
still wiring custom infra scripts or declarations for each chunk of the data
eng toolset. Part of the story here is just maturity: front-end web dev went
through incredible churn before stabilizing and standardizing on React. Data
eng is still in the churn phase where closed source and open source are
competing, and then we have a bunch of open-core with managed solutions without
a full stack one (you end up like "let's wire together dbt cloud with google
composer with ...").

We also (unfortunately) are still in an era of churn with data warehouses,
where the adoption of snowflake/bigquery/redshift is still dominant and no
open-source/locally runnable solution has taken over the web saw with Postgres
and MySQL.

I think you could put these two sort of seperate thoughts together and say,
look how Nextjs rolled up React with the minimum viable supporting toolset, and
then became sort of a platform for additional plugins and tools ("to get
started with nextjs..."), can't we do the same by rolling up dbt/airflow/airbyte/etc
and an open source columnar database?

Maybe the analogy doesn't make sense. The web is a much bigger platform than
internal data management. But I think declarative, zero-config, opinionated
infra meta-framework would be a preferred workflow for me, and I think we're in
an interesting place where the existing open-core solutions like dbt maybe
already have a path towards that as a single managed platform, but don't
necessarily seem like they're going there, and maybe that's a opening for
something new.
