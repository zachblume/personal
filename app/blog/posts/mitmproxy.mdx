I've always been a print debugging kind of person and appreciate
`console.log({...})`'s ability to keep the variable name and value together.

The value of that is you can execute it regardless of the environment and
generally find the log without much knowlege as to the specifics of the
execution config.

The other trick I have picked up when even more unsure of the execution
environment (e.g. code hosted _inside_ auth0's login posthooks) is to throw an
error with the variable I want to inspect. Since they stop execution, or at
least make it up a layer or more, you're more likely to find them in a
confusing situation.

But honestly -- we have better tools!

1. VSCode:

The main issue here for me when debugging a real-world application is that I
want to be able to add breakpoints and inspect both the frontend and backend at
the same time.

The solution is having a launch.json that has multiple configurations, one for
the frontend and one for the backend. You can then run both at the same time
and have the debugger stop at breakpoints in either. Unfortunately you have to
manually press the play button on both configurations.

2. mitmproxy:

It took me a while to learn the above debugger native to vscode partially
because chrome ships with such good devtools -- they are better than the built
in vscode debugger!

You can attach the devtools to a node process, but you end up with something
more like vscode than the native devtools.

The biggest difference that makes a difference for me is the lack of a network
tab.

I want to see the network requests and responses in a way that is easy to read
and filter. I want to see the headers, the payloads, timing, all that.

mitmproxy is that, but in a TUI instead of a graphical interface. It's a proxy
that you run on your machine and then set your computer's wifi/networking to
route through, so you can inspect, replay, and modify network requests.

3. bruno:

Normally, life goes a bit like this:

```
chrome devtools -> network -> right click -> copy as curl -> paste to vscode and edit -> paste to terminal
```

It goes a long way, but once you have 1k character auth tokens in there and
then you find some Apis like Twilio still use form encoding instead of JSON but
only half the time, etc etc, something more robust is nice.

Postman was that, and now is trash, and wants me to login with google for some
reason. No.

Bruno is a nice free open source alternative that has the ability to stage and
run curls and collections of curls, and to boot its logo is a dog so you know,
got me there.
