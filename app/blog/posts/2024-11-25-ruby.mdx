A couple things I like about Ruby:

- Implicit return can produce really elegant code
- Ruby is more consistent than javascript about "everything is an object" and
  providing all the object information as accessors like
  `variablename.class`, you sort of can just keep typing dots to process
  things.
- Thinking through the above point is interesting because documentation
  insists this is the object orientation of Ruby but provides for a very nice
  "functional" style to things where instead of imperative writing you're
  writing a lot of chained dots.
- I like the maniacal allowance for dropping paranthesis in calls and
  argument enumeration. That's a truly cursed idea and I sort of like it.

Things I dislike

- The peculiar behavior of passing lambdas to methods as a special syntax
  strikes me as quite odd and out of pattern
- The "principle of least surprise" is sort of hilarious lie, because at
  the same time that array.length array.count and array.size mean the same
  thing, `do something; end` and `{|| whatever}` have different operator
  binding precedence, and so does `&&` and `and`. Not only that, but there's
  all these random magic symbols that no other language uses like `@` instead
  of `self.` and then randomly you can use `self.` but it means something
  else. Oh and error handling is not done using `throw catch` but THERE IS a
  `throw catch` that does something entirely different! Rubyists describe
  this as being handed sharp knives but I feel like it's more like being
  handed a knife pointy-end first.
- To the above point, the elimination of english keywords like `return` do
  seem very out of pattern for the `it should read like english` purpose of
  Ruby. `do 1; end` returns `1`? How was I supposed to know that?
- Async ruby reads crazy
- Just random terrifying defaults like `"    ".split` returning `[]` empty
  array. Help, I'm trapped inside a weird computer.

Anyways -- I like Ruby. It's a fun language -- in the same way being tipsy is
fun.
